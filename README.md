# Oxford Machine Learning Summer School 2023 Experience

Welcome to my repository documenting my experience at the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School 2023. This repository serves as a platform to share insights and resources related to the program, my master's report, and the labs completed during this educational journey.

## About the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School

The Oxford Machine Learning Summer School 2023, organized by AI for Global Goals in collaboration with CIFAR and the University of Oxfordâ€™s Deep Medicine Program, offered a comprehensive exploration of machine learning, covering both fundamental principles and real-world case studies.

## Master's Report

As part of my master's program, I had the opportunity to create a report based on my experiences at the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School 2023. You can access the full report [here](https://github.com/Maxime-Jauroyon/OxML-2023/blob/main/OxML_Report.pdf).
Please note that the report does not include my experiences from the ML x Finance module due to a deadline constraint.

## ML x Cases Labs

During the summer school, I completed labs as part of the ML x Cases module. These labs are available on my Kaggle profile. You can access them [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maximejauroyon/competitions?tab=completed).

Feel free to explore these labs. Your feedback and comments are always appreciated.
